### App Idea  
For my personal project, I would like to create a **habit-tracking app** that helps users build and maintain new habits. The app will feature:

- A progress tracker to visualize habit streaks  

## Notes  

One challenge I encountered was finding the **Storyboard file** and enabling the **Assistant Editor** to connect UI elements to logic. I solved this by adjusting the editor layout and ensuring that the correct files were open.
